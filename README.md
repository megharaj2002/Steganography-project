# Steganography Tool

This project is a Python-based steganography tool that uses the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique to hide and retrieve secret messages within images. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter and styled with a dark theme.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Embed a secret message into an image.
- **Decryption**: Extract the hidden message from an image.
- **Passcode Protection**: Secure the hidden message using a passcode.
- **GUI Interface**: User-friendly interface with separate tabs for encryption and decryption.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.13**: The primary programming language.
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: For image processing (reading, writing, and modifying images).
- **NumPy**: For efficient array manipulation, especially for pixel data.
- **Tkinter & ttk**: For creating the GUI with a dark theme.
- **OS Module**: For file path operations and checking file existence.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone
   cd <repository-folder>
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python 3.13 installed.Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy

## Usage 

**Configuring the Folder/Image Path** 

The current code uses a fixed folder path (F:\Python\steganography project) and expects an image file named mypic.jpg in that folder. To change these settings:
1. Open the code file.
2. In both the encrypt() and decrypt() functions, update the folder variable to your desired path:
   ```bash
   folder = r"your\desired\folder\path"
3. Update the image file name if needed:
   ```bash
   Update the image file name if needed:
4. Ensure that the specified image exists in the given folder before running the program.

## Running the program

1. Save the provided code into a file, for example, steganography_tool.py.
2. Run the script from the command line:
   ```bash
   python steganography_tool.py
3. The GUI will open with two tabs:

- **Encryption Tab**: Enter your secret message and passcode, then click "Encrypt" to embed the message into the image. The encrypted image (encryptedpic.png) will be saved in your configured folder.

- **Decryption Tab**: Enter the passcode to retrieve the hidden message from the encrypted image.
